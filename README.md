# RareGreens Website  
RareGreens is a website designed to improve the awareness of endangered plants that exist in Victoria.This is achieved in multiple ways：  
1. Several typical endangered plants and vulnerable plants in Victoria are introduced to users    
2. Introduce to users how to protect these endangered plants      
3. Introduce several plants that can be planted in the garden and provide video teaching    
4. Provide games and quiz to deepen users' understanding of endangered plants    

# Motivation  
Our production team is composed of four graduate students from Monash University. Everyone in the team is very interested in protecting local plants, and wants to help those who want to take practical actions to protect plants. In addition, we also want to spread to people who don’t realize the dangerous situation of plants  the knowledge and current status of plants. Based on the above reasons, we designed this website to help our target audience
